I just knead it right in the bowl.  Stop kneading as soon as the dough comes together and is soft and not too stickydo not over knead!  Try to knead it no more than 10 times if that helps.Form a ball, place it in the center of the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm spot for 20 minutes.After 20 minutes the dough wont really look any different, dont worry about it.  Divide the dough into 8 sections and roll into balls.Re-cover the balls with the plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.On a floured surface roll the balls out, either in a round or oval shape.  Meanwhile heat an iron skillet (or just plain skillet if thats all you have) on medium-high heat.Whack the rolled out dough onto the hot skillet and cover with a lid.

You can find more recipes here: http://sallycooks.com  So far this is my favorite recipe from the November issue because it tasted amazing and was a big hit with Joe. I made a few changes to the recipe; I added more chocolate and instead of three cups of milk, I used 1 and 1/2 cups of milk and 1 and 1/2 cups of coffee to give the pudding a slight mocha taste.  I also left out the dark rum and doubled up on the vanilla extract.  If you want to add in rum use 1 tablespoon dark rum and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  I skipped the step to strain the pudding through a sieve into a medium bowl and I found that the pudding was perfectly smooth.    The pudding can be refrigerated for up to 3 days so this would be a great dessert to make ahead and wow your guests especially if you have some homemade whipped cream.  It was so good.
