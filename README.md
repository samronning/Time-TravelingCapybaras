Our meal planning app hopes to fill the role of a convenient meal planning tool
for a variety of scenarios. Meal planning is gaining popularity as it is a way
to shop more efficiently and make the best of all ingredients purchased.
Through our app, we can provide access to simple recipes that scale well
and include ingredient lists that can ideally be found locally, perhaps
even in walking distance. It will allow users to easily organize their
recipes, plan their meals and grocery lists, and discover new healthy ways
to eat. This could be most beneficial to communities in urban or rural
areas without easy access to large chain grocery stores, where planning
is most necessary. To accomplish our goals in our time frame, we plan on
working towards a concrete deliverable while evaluating our progress through
quantitative measurements such as passing tests, new users, completed project
tasks. However, we also plan on evaluating through source reviews from friends,
family, as well as groups who work and live in food deserts to gain their perspective.
